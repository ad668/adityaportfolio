          "This project is a basic Movie Recommendation System that utilizes various machine learning techniques to suggest similar movies based on user input. The system performs data preprocessing, including vectorization, stopword removal, and stemming, to enhance the accuracy of recommendations. When a user types a movie name in the input box, the model suggests five similar movies based on the processed data.",
